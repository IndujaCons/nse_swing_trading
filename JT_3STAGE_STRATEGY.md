# JT 3-Stage Scale-Out Strategy

## Overview

Momentum dip-buying strategy on Nifty 100 stocks combining two signal types (J, T) with a 3-stage partial exit system. Capital: 20L, 2L per trade, 2 entries/day.

---

## Entry Signals

### Strategy J — Weekly Support Bounce
- **Condition**: Close within 0-3% above weekly support level, IBS > 0.5, green candle, CCI(20) > -100, **no gap-down** (open >= prev close)
- **Support calculation**: 26-week rolling min of weekly close, **skipping the last 2 weeks** (current + previous). Uses proven support levels, not recent noise.
- **Stop**: Below weekly low (support break), also skipping last 2 weeks
- **Edge**: Defined structural support gives tight risk

### Strategy T — Keltner Channel Pullback
- **Condition**: Price within 1% of EMA(20), stock touched upper Keltner band (EMA20 + 2x ATR14) in last 10 bars, green candle, **no gap-down** (open >= prev close)
- **Stop**: 5% hard SL (tightens to 3% after first +6% partial exit — see Exit Rules)
- **Edge**: Buying a pullback in a confirmed uptrend (was recently at upper band = strong momentum)

### Gap-Down Filter (applies to both J and T)
- **Rule**: Skip entry if today's Open < yesterday's Close (stock gapped down)
- **Why**: Analysis of top 10 losses in 2018 showed 9/10 had gap-down entries on low volume — classic "dead cat bounce" pattern. Filtering these improves avg return by +2.6%/yr and eliminates losing years.

---

## Exit Rules

### Strategy J Exits
J uses its own exit logic (not the 3-stage system):
1. **Support break**: Full exit if price drops below weekly low stop (with Nifty shield — skipped if Nifty dropped same % or more)
2. **+5%**: Sell 50%
3. **+10%**: Sell remaining
4. **Chandelier exit**: After partial, sell remaining if price < Highest High (since entry) - 3x ATR(14)

### Strategy T Exits (3-Stage)
1. **Hard SL**: 5% below entry — exit all remaining shares
2. **+6%**: Sell 1/3 of shares (lock in first profit)
3. **Tight SL kicks in**: After first +6% exit, SL tightens from 5% to **3%** on remaining shares
4. **+10%**: Sell 1/3 of shares (lock in second profit)
5. **Indicator exit on remaining 1/3**: Price reaches upper Keltner band (EMA20 + 2x ATR14)

### Underwater Exit (applies to both J and T)
- **Rule**: If a trade is held for **10+ trading days** and price is still **below entry price**, exit at close
- **Why**: Analysis of 2024-2025 biggest losses showed a common "falling knife" pattern — stocks entering near support but drifting lower for weeks. Cutting these losers after 10 days frees capital for better opportunities.
- **Impact**: +4.52L improvement over 11 years, turned 2015 from a losing year into a winning year (11/11 positive years)
- **Nifty shield NOT used**: Tested shielding underwater exit when Nifty itself was underwater — it neutralized the benefit entirely (-865 vs baseline). Pure discipline of cutting losers works better.

### Why 3% Tight SL After First Target
After Strategy T hits the first +6% target and sells 1/3, the remaining 2/3 position has a real risk: the stock can reverse and hit the original 5% SL, giving back more than the +6% partial profit.

Tested across 11 years (2015-2025):

| SL after 1st exit | Total P&L | Avg/yr | Delta vs 5% |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5% (original) | Rs 47.76L | 21.71% | — |
| 4% | Rs 47.42L | 21.56% | -0.34L |
| **3% (adopted)** | **Rs 48.1L** | **~22%** | **+2.36L** |

3% SL was positive in 9/11 years. It works through faster capital recycling — losing positions are cut sooner, freeing money for winning trades.

### Why 3-Stage with 6/10 Targets
The original system sold 1/2 at +5% and exited the other 1/2 on indicator. The 3-stage system with wider targets:
- Sells only 1/3 at +6% (keeps more capital in the trade, lets winners run further)
- Adds a +10% exit for 1/3 (captures a much larger profit tier)
- Lets the final 1/3 ride the full indicator exit
- Wider targets (6/10 vs 5/8) add +1.99%/yr and increase avg win by Rs 899/trade (+12%)

## Signal Ranking — ATR% (Lowest Volatility First)

When multiple signals fire on the same day and you have limited slots (2/day):

### Current Method: Rank by ATR% (ATR14 / Price)
- **Sort**: Lowest `atr_norm` first — prefer calmer, less volatile stocks
- **Logic**: Lower volatility stocks are less likely to gap through stops and more likely to have orderly pullbacks that recover to targets
- **Tiebreaker**: Seed-based random jitter for reproducibility

### Why ATR% over Stop%
Four ranking strategies were tested across 11 years (2015-2025):

| Rank Method | Total PnL | Avg Ret/yr | Positive Yrs | Avg WR | Avg PF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B: ATR% (current)** | **+43.88L** | **+19.95%** | **11/11** | **67.1%** | **1.79** |
| A: Stop% (old) | +40.40L | +18.36% | 9/11 | 66.6% | 1.79 |
| C: Trend/Risk | +42.42L | +19.28% | 10/11 | 68.5% | 1.75 |
| D: Composite | +42.48L | +19.31% | 11/11 | 67.8% | 1.82 |

ATR% ranking:
- **+3.48L more** than old Stop% ranking over 11 years
- **Eliminates both losing years** (2015: -2.0% -> +0.6%, 2018: -2.6% -> +5.0%)
- Entry conditions already filter for trend quality, so ranking by volatility avoids double-counting
- Slight weakness in very strong trending markets (2019, 2023) where volatile runners get skipped

### Stop% is still displayed
The UI shows both ATR% (ranking column) and Stop% (SL distance) in the Top Picks panel so you can see the risk profile of each signal.

## Backtest Results — 11 Years (2015-2025), Nifty 100

### Current Baseline (3-Stage 6/10 + Gap-Down + ATR% Ranking + Skip 2wk Support + UW Exit 10d + T Tight SL 3%)

| Year | Trades | WR% | Return% | P&L | AvgWin | AvgLoss | PF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025 | 219 | 48.4% | 18.60% | +3,72,077 | 7,998 | -4,209 | 1.78 |
| 2024 | 222 | 60.8% | 26.32% | +5,26,364 | 8,092 | -6,505 | 1.93 |
| 2023 | 215 | 60.9% | 32.56% | +6,51,226 | 8,363 | -5,290 | 2.47 |
| 2022 | 230 | 55.7% | 17.25% | +3,44,978 | 8,277 | -7,004 | 1.48 |
| 2021 | 228 | 52.6% | 25.31% | +5,06,140 | 9,232 | -5,570 | 1.84 |

| 2019 | 233 | 48.9% | 9.05% | +1,81,070 | 8,065 | -6,206 | 1.24 |
| 2018 | 207 | 50.2% | 10.20% | +2,04,067 | 7,670 | -5,764 | 1.34 |
| 2017 | 219 | 59.8% | 41.49% | +8,29,706 | 9,272 | -4,374 | 3.16 |
| 2016 | 215 | 48.8% | 18.12% | +3,62,322 | 8,175 | -4,509 | 1.73 |
| 2015 | 209 | 47.8% | 5.73% | +1,14,528 | 8,020 | -6,306 | 1.17 |
| **Avg/yr** | **222** | **54.1%** | **~22%** | **+4,32,068** | **8,342** | **-5,746** | **1.72** |

- **Positive years: 11/11**
- **Best year: +41.49% (2017)**
- **Worst year: +5.73% (2015)**
- **Total P&L: Rs ~47.5 Lakhs on 20L capital over 11 years**
- **Avg Win/Loss ratio: 1.5x** (make Rs 8,342 on winners, lose Rs 5,746 on losers)

### Why Skip 2 Weeks of Support
J support uses the 26-week rolling min of weekly closes. Including the last 2 weeks (current + previous) means support can be set by very recent price action that hasn't been tested. Shifting by 2 weeks uses only proven support levels — prices the market has bounced from and held for at least 2 weeks.

## Filters/Rules Tested and Rejected

### Earnings Blackout (5 days before quarterly results)
- **Idea**: Block entries during peak results season (Jan 10-Feb 10, Apr 10-May 10, Jul 10-Aug 10, Oct 10-Nov 10)
- **Result**: Blocked ~400 trades across 11 years, lost **-14.23L** vs baseline
- **Verdict**: Rejected. Too blunt — blocks good trades along with bad ones. The strategy already has stop-losses to handle earnings-related drops.

### T Chandelier Exit for Stage 2 (trailing stop on last 1/3)
- **Idea**: After T's first two partial exits, use Chandelier exit (Highest High - 3x ATR14) on the remaining 1/3 instead of waiting for upper Keltner
- **Result**: **-1.02L** vs baseline over 11 years
- **Verdict**: Rejected. Cuts T winners short before they reach upper Keltner. The upper Keltner exit already acts as a natural trailing indicator.

### Nifty Shield for Underwater Exit
- **Idea**: Skip underwater exit if Nifty index itself is also underwater (market-wide fall, not stock-specific)
- **Result**: Neutralized the underwater exit benefit entirely (-865 vs baseline instead of +4.52L)
- **Verdict**: Rejected. A losing position is a losing position regardless of market context. Pure discipline of cutting losers after 10 days works better than making excuses for them.

### EMA20 Rising Filter (for T signals)
- **Idea**: Only take T entries when EMA20 is rising over last N bars (uptrend confirmation)
- **Tested**: 20-bar and 10-bar lookback across 10 years
- **Result**: 10-bar showed +37K on aggregate but **0/10 years positive** on per-year testing, -3.45L total
- **Verdict**: Rejected. T entry conditions already require "was at upper Keltner" which implies uptrend. Adding EMA slope is double-filtering and hurts more than helps.

### Momentum Smoothness Filter (for T signals)
- **Idea**: Only take T entries when `20d_return / 20d_stdev > threshold` (mini Sharpe ratio — prefer smooth momentum)
- **Tested**: Thresholds 0.0, 0.3, 0.5 across 10 years
- **Result**: Only threshold 0.0 showed marginal aggregate improvement (+42K), but per-year: 4/10 wins, -1.03L total
- **Verdict**: Rejected. The signal is not strong enough on per-year validation.

### 4% Tight SL After First T Target
- **Idea**: Tighten SL from 5% to 4% (instead of 3%) after first +6% exit
- **Result**: **-0.34L** vs baseline — actually slightly worse than keeping 5%
- **Verdict**: Rejected. 4% is too close to the noise band. 3% is the sweet spot — tight enough to save capital but not so tight it shakes out recoverable dips.

## Code Paths — All Three in Sync

The strategy runs in three places. All three use identical entry/exit logic:

| Feature | Backtest Engine | Live Signals | UI API |
|---|---|---|---|
| File | `data/momentum_backtest.py` | `data/live_signals_engine.py` | `ui/app.py` |
| Gap-down filter | `no_gap_down=True` | Open < prev close → skip | `no_gap_down=True` |
| ATR% ranking | `rank_by_risk=True` | Sort by `atr_pct` | `rank_by_risk=True` |
| Underwater exit | `underwater_exit_days=10` | 10 trading days check | `underwater_exit_days=10` |
| T tight SL | `t_tight_sl=0.03` | 3% after stage >= 1 | `t_tight_sl=0.03` |
| J Nifty shield | SL skip if Nifty fell more | SL skip if Nifty fell more | — |
| J Chandelier | HH - 3x ATR14 after partial | HH - 3x ATR14 after partial | — |
| T 3-stage | 6% / 10% / Keltner | 6% / 10% / Keltner | `three_stage_exit=True` |

## Risk Notes

- 2015 and 2019 are the weakest years (+5.68% and +8.29%). Both are choppy sideways markets.
- 2018 is weak (+11.77%) due to broad market correction.
- ATR% ranking can underperform in strong trending markets where volatile stocks are the big runners.
- Results are based on daily closing prices. Live execution at different prices will cause slippage.
- T strategy SL slippage in backtest is an artifact of daily-bar checking. Live trading with actual SL orders will have tighter stops.
- Capital check: entries are skipped if trade cost would exceed available capital (20L + running PnL - deployed). Prevents over-leveraging after losses.
- Gap-down filter reduces trade count by ~10% (filters low-conviction "dead cat bounce" entries).
- ~204-241 trades per year (avg 224), mix of J and T.
- yfinance data variability: backtest numbers can shift ~0.5-1% between runs due to Yahoo Finance adjusting historical prices for splits/dividends.
